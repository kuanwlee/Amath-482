# Amath-482

This project is about implementing some common data analysis algorithms on MATLAB. There are five .m files and each correspond 
to different data analysis techniques.

Fourierdenoise.m is about denoising ultra-sound signals with Fourier trasformation

TimeFrequencyAnalysis.m is about performing time requency analysis and create spectrograms on audio signals

PCA_analysis.m is about tracking the motion of a paint can and perform PCA analysis on the position data of the paint can to 
model the paint can motion.

music_classification.m is about utilizing machine learning to categorize five seconds music clips.

neuralnetwork.m is about constructing a neural network that classifies images.

Each project has a correspnding documents that contain the theoretical backgrounds of the data analysis techniques and
computational results.
